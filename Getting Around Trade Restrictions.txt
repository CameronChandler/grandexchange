20 HRS, 100 Total Level and 10QP?

As mentioned before, in order to get around these new restrictions accounts need to have 20hrs, 100 total level and 10QP. So what are the most efficient methods of meeting these conditions?

Lets start with getting 100 Total Level and 10QP

Luckily with the way how f2p quests are rewarded, it's possible to get 100 total level purely by completing quests and also get 10QP at the same time.

The following quest order will achieve just that:

Cooks Assistant
X marks the spot
Restless Ghost
Imp Catcher
Dorics Quest
Witch's Potion
Knight Sword
Vampire Slayer
Completing these quests will get you 100 total level and 10QP.

However, it's possible to get the 10QP seperately then get 100 total level in whatever stats you need.

For example, complete Romeo and Juliet and Goblin Diplomacy to get 10QP. Then woodcutting/mining to whatever stats needed for your farm etc.

Probably the hardest part of all this is reaching 20HRS ingame time. Since 20HRS is plenty of time for Jagex to pick out and ban accounts, the only real way to get around this is to afk for 20hrs by using a script or by hand.
